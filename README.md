# One-Click AI Sandbox

A Linode Marketplace App that deploys a complete, pre-configured AI inference stack with both a chat UI and an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint in minutes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started quickly by deploying to a clean Linode GPU instance. See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## ✨ Features

- **One-Click Deployment**: Fully automated setup via Linode Marketplace
- **Complete AI Stack**: Includes both a web-based chat interface and an OpenAI-compatible API
- **Pre-Configured**: NVIDIA drivers, Docker, and all dependencies pre-installed
- **Fast Time-to-Value**: From instance boot to working AI in under 5 minutes
- **Model Flexibility**: Choose any model from Hugging Face at deployment
- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI endpoints—just change your `BASE_URL`

## 🏗️ Architecture

The AI Sandbox consists of two containerized services working together to provide a complete AI inference stack. See the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md) for detailed information.

## 📋 Requirements

- A Linode GPU instance (any supported GPU instance type)
  - **Note**: GPU instances require GPU access to be enabled on your account. If you don't see GPU instance types available, please contact Linode Support to enable GPU access.
- Linode CLI configured with API token (for script-based deployment)

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For AI Explorers
Try the latest open-source models (like Llama 3) in a chat interface without writing code or paying per-token API fees.

### For Backend Engineers
Get a stable, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. Point your existing application to your own endpoint by simply changing the `BASE_URL`.

### For Full-Stack Developers
Use the chat UI to experiment with prompts, then use the same underlying API in your application for consistent results.

## 🚦 Getting Started

See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md) for detailed deployment instructions. The guide covers:

- Prerequisites and setup
- Deploying to a clean Linode GPU instance
- Accessing your services after deployment
- Troubleshooting common issues

## 🔒 Security

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: By default, both services are exposed to the internet without authentication. You must configure a Linode Cloud Firewall to protect your services.

See the [Security Guide](docs/security.md) for detailed firewall setup instructions and security best practices.

## 🛠️ Maintenance

Common maintenance tasks including updating services, changing models, viewing logs, and troubleshooting are covered in the [Maintenance Guide](docs/maintenance.md).

## 📝 Limitations (V1)

- No automatic API authentication (use firewall)
- No user accounts for the UI (open by default)
- No automatic HTTPS/SSL
- Inference only (no fine-tuning support)
